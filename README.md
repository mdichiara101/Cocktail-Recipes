# Cocktail-Recipes

This was a project I started March 31, 2021 after I spent months learning SwiftUI. I am the sole creator/developer of this project. It is basically compelte may add minor adjustments here and there. I decided to do this project to get more knowledge with api calls and structuring in MVVM

The project is simple it list cocktail recipes from cocktail recipe api. Then finally the Random tab generates 3 random cocktails.

You can search for cocktails by ingredient in the search view tab.

The category view tab will show you all the categories for the cocktail recipes. You can select a category and you will be taken to a list of cocktails classified in the selected category.

The all Cocktail recipes view tab will list all the cocktails retrieved from the api.

Then finally the Random tab generates 3 random cocktails. The user can generate another set of cocktails by tapping on the random cocktail label

Each one of the tab views will result in the user selecting a single cocktail recipe which will take the user to a new view that will show the ingredients and the instructions on how to make the cocktail.

Things Im debating on implementing: Entire new tab view that shows a grid of ingredients the User can check and then will display a list of cocktails containing those ingredients. To fully implement MVVM structure once I learn more about it through experience.

Technologies: - SwiftUI - Xcode - JSON API - CocoaPods - Structure Attempt: MVVM
